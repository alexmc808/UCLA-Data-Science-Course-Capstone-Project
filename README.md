Repository for UCLA Extension Data Science Certification course related to the Capstone Project in which I use R to analyze a data set of my choice. The data I chose for this project is from data.world (url: https://data.world/chhs/06ed38d3-b047-4ae2-aa00-2e43b5491d6e). This data set includes the risk adjusted 30 day readmissions rates and 30 day mortality rates for ischemic stroke patients, as well as quality ratings for hospitals in California over the years of 2011-2015. The research question I want to answer through analyzing this data is: why do different hospitals in California have different risk adjusted rates for ischemic stroke patients? In order to answer this question, I also extracted data from the American Community Survey (ACS) to pull potential demographic predictor variables such as population estimate, median household income, city human capital index, poverty rate, and age for 2011-2015. I additionally pulled data from California Health and Human Services (url: https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/healthcare-facility-locations/resource/098bbc36-044d-441f-9442-1f4db4d8aaa0) to expand my data to include more potential predictor variables such as capacity (number of hospital beds), business name (e.g. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, and entity type (e.g. nonprofit corporation, limited liability company). After cleaning/managing the data and doing some exploratory data analysis, I ran linear regression models to determine whether there are any significant predictor variables.
